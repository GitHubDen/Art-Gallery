<h3>About this website</h3>
<div>Online Art Store: Design, develop and test an “Art Store” (paintings and /or sculptures) web-site build on the structure of your Assignment - 1 with the following requirements (the web-pages should be developed primarily using HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScripts ): <br>The assignment was broken up into two iterations: <br> I - Displaying and assessing information through menus and preset info. A majority of this involves the black navigation buttons and the pages accessible by clicking on some key names. <br> II - Displaying and assessing information through a database, as well as being able to control the content in a data base from the website. A majority of this involves the blue buttons and the 'Maintain' button.  </div>
<div>Major Design Features: <br>1<br> - The main page of the system (Home) contains - Options at top of the page including “Home” , “About us” , and “Blogs” <br>- Three drop - down list at the left of the page including “Art Works” , “Artists” , and “Museum” (at least 5 items for each list). <br>- A “Shopping Cart” icon should appear at the top of the page as well</div>
<br>
<div>2 <br>- By selecting any item from the list of Art Works , two small box es will appear at the right and center part of the main page including the small im age of the art work and its brief information in those boxes respectively. The size of the boxes should be fixed for any selected item . The information box contains only the name, general description, and the price of the Art Work.</div>
<br>
<div>3 <br>- By clicking on the name of the Art Work the main window will be replaced with a new window that is divided into two parts : <br>- Part1 at the left that contains the large size of the image of the Art Work, and <br>- Part2 at the right that contains more details about the Art Work: Date of creation , Type of the painting’s colors, Dimensions , Location it is currently being saved, Artist name who created it, Price in US dollars , and Genres ( e.g. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Pre-Modern, and Modern) . The shopping cart icon should appear on this page as well.</div>
<br>
<div>4 <br>- By selecting any item from the list of Artists, two small boxes will appear at the right and center part of the main page including the small image of the artist and his/her brief information in those boxes respectively. The size of those boxes should be fixed for any selected item . The information box contains only the name, and general description about the artist</div>
<br>
<div>5 <br>- By clicking on the name of the Artist the main window will be replaced with a new window that is divided into two parts : <br>- Part1 at the left that contains the large size of the image of the Artist , and <br>- Part2 at the right that contains more details about the Artist : Date of birth/death of the artist, Place of his/her living, Genres of his/her paintings (e.g. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Pre-Modern, and Modern), Famous of his /her piece of works.</div>

If the item was already purchased; the total of invoices should appear in the dialogue box. <br> - Shopping cart can be found in selected web pages. </div>
<br>
<div>7 <br>- Create Artists, Art Works, Images (small and large sizes), Museums, Galleries, Genres, Subjects, and Reviews tables along with intermediate tables (if required). Since all web - pages will need to access all tables, you should generalize your data base retrieval code into separate classes. Tables should be related preferably based on numeric code.</div>
<br>
<div>8<br>- Each of the images and information shown from the drop-down lists must be linked with appropriate query string.</div>
<br>
<div>9<br>- Use proper keywords in tables to facilitate storing, retrieving, sorting, filtering and manipulating of data .</div>
<br>
<div>10 <br>- Add another option at the top of the main page as “Search” which brings your system to search mode. By clicking on the “Search”, a search dialogue box will be displayed at the top right of the main page for the users to search specific Art Work s through the data base tables. The results of the search should be displayed at the bottom right of the main pa</div>
<br>
<div>11 <br>- Add another option at the top of the main page as “Maintain” which brings your system to maintain mode: add proper functions to add, delete, and modify the contents of your designed data base tables. By selecting this option a new window should be displayed with proper input boxes</div>
<br>
<div>12 <br>- Test your application on the lab computers; it should work on FireFox and/or IE browsers too (at least). </div>
